# Fintech Growth Animated Sales Tile

This project contains a high-fidelity recreation of a fintech landing page featuring a complex, interactive data visualization component (`FinServTile`).

## Description
The core focus is the `FinServTile` component: a self-contained, 600x600 responsive React component. It features orbiting rings, floating data cards with organic motion, and SVG chart animations. The component uses Framer Motion for high-performance animations (including draggability) and Tailwind CSS for precise styling, perfectly mimicking the provided design spec.

## Tech Stack
*   **React 18+**
*   **TypeScript**
*   **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN for portability)
*   **Framer Motion** (Animation & Drag physics)
*   **Lucide React** (Icons)

## Usage
1.  Navigate to `App.tsx` to see the full landing page context.
2.  The isolated component is located at `components/FinServTile.tsx`.
3.  The tile is fully responsive but optimized for a square aspect ratio. It fits into any container but works best when given a max-width of around 600px.
4.  Try dragging the floating cards in the visualization!
